#1 Installation of ROS and Gazebo on Ubuntu System.
* First of all, I installed ROS noetic version in my Ubuntu machine in VirtualBox.
I then checked the version of ROS to check if it has been installed properly using the command 'rosversion -d'.

* After that I checked if the standalone Gazebo was working properly and checked the version of Gazebo using command 'gazebo --version'.
Then, I tried to start gazebo using the roslaunch command 'roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch'.
